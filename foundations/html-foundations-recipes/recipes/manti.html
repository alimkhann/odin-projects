    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Manti are large, succulent steamed dumplings filled with finely chopped meat and onions. <br>
        They are characterized by their thin, delicate dough and the rich juices trapped inside, often <br>
        served with sour cream or a spicy tomato sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>3 Large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>400g Flour</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, and cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Knead flour, water, and egg into a firm dough; let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the meat with onions and spices. The onion ratio is high to ensure the filling stays juicy.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough thin and cut into squares.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of filling in each square and pinch the corners together to seal.</li>
        <li>Steam in a multi-tiered steamer (mantovarka) for 40-45 minutes.</li>
