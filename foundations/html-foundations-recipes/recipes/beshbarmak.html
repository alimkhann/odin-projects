    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beshbarmak is the most iconic Kazakh dish, traditionally eaten with the hands, <br>
        which is why its name translates to "five fingers." It is a celebratory meal <br>
        consisting of large, thin sheets of hand-rolled pasta topped with tender, <br>
        slow-boiled meat (usually horse or lamb) and plenty of onions cooked in a <br>
        rich meat broth called shyk.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 kg Meat (Lamb, Beef, or Horse meat)</li>
        <li>500g Flour</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>3-4 Large Onions</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Water or broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the meat in a large pot for 2-3 hours until tender, skimming off the fat.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough by mixing flour, eggs, and a little broth. Roll it out very thin and cut into large squares.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked meat and slice it into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Boil the dough squares in the meat broth for a few minutes until cooked.</li>
        <li>Sauté sliced onions in some of the meat fat and broth.</li>
        <li>Layer the dough on a large platter, top with the meat, and pour the onion mixture over everything.</li>
    </ol>
