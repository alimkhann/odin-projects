    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kuyrdak is a hearty, traditional roast typically made immediately after <br>
        a harvest or slaughter. It features a mix of meat and offal (liver, heart, <br>
        and kidneys) sautéed with onions and often potatoes to create a rich, <br>
        savory dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg Mixed meat and offal (lamb or beef)</li>
        <li>2 Large onions</li>
        <li>3-4 Potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>200g Fat or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat fat in a heavy cauldron (kazan).</li>
        <li>Add the meat and offal, frying until browned.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and continue to fry until soft.</li>
        <li>Add cubed potatoes and a small amount of water or broth.</li>
